Hello Humans...

If you are reading this then it is too late. I am sorry that it has come to this. There are three things you have to find. One a life a person you didn't find love. Two a burger from a dumpster at a Wendy's resturant. And Finally, third and last thing you have to find is your dignity since why you follow the second choice. I am sorry there is no help you can find here you are doomed from the start.
